# AI Persona & Instruction System

> **Author:** Marco Siccardi (MSiccDev Software Development)  
> **Purpose:** A structured instruction framework for maintaining consistent, context-aware AI collaboration across different LLM providers, projects, and development phases.

---

## Overview

This repository provides a **comprehensive AI instruction and workspace configuration system** designed to enable consistent, context-aware AI collaboration across multiple projects and platforms.

### The Evolution

What began as a way to extract and reuse prompts across AI providers has evolved into a sophisticated **instruction-based architecture** for AI collaboration:

- **Not just prompts** – These are persistent instruction sets that define working context
- **Layered architecture** – Personal persona + project-specific instructions create complete AI workspace configurations
- **Provider-agnostic** – Works seamlessly across different LLM environments

### The System

This framework consists of:
- **Personal persona instructions** – Your professional identity, skills, preferences, and working style
- **Project-specific instructions** – Scope, tech stack, roles, objectives, and guidelines per project
- **Session specification** – How AI assistants should maintain and adapt context during work sessions
- **Templates** – For creating new instruction sets quickly and consistently

All components work seamlessly across different LLM environments (Anthropic Claude, GitHub Copilot, Mistral, Gemini, LM Studio, Ollama, etc.), ensuring that every AI assistant understands your background, working style, and project context without repeated explanations.

## Core Concepts

### The Instruction vs. Prompt Distinction

**Instructions** are persistent context and guidelines that define:
- WHO you are (persona)
- WHAT the project is (project context)
- HOW the AI should behave (roles, phases, preferences)

**Prompts** are your day-to-day requests within that instructed environment:
- "Create a new API endpoint"
- "Review this code for security issues"
- "Switch to Developer Mode and implement this feature"

This repository provides the **instruction layer** that makes your prompts more effective.

---

### 1. **Personal Persona Instructions**
Your foundational AI context that includes:
- Professional background and current role
- Technical skills and expertise areas
- Active projects and goals
- Preferred working style and communication preferences
- Constraints and limitations

**Purpose:** Serves as the base instruction layer that AI assistants load first to understand who you are and how you work globally.

### 2. **Project Instructions**
Project-specific instruction sets that define:
- Project scope and objectives
- Technology stack and architecture
- Recommended AI roles (Architect, Developer, Designer, etc.)
- Default work phases (Planning, Implementation, Debugging, Review)
- Project-specific constraints and guidelines

**Purpose:** Provides focused, project-specific instructions that layer on top of your persona to create complete working context.

### 3. **Session State Model**
A structured approach to AI collaboration that manages context dynamically:

| Element | Description | Example Values |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Persona** | Your identity, skills, and preferences | Defined in your persona instructions |
| **Project** | Active domain or codebase | "Mobile UI app", "Backend API" |
| **Role/Mode** | AI's cognitive stance | Architect, Developer, Designer, Reviewer |
| **Phase** | Current work stage | Planning, Implementation, Debugging, Review |
| **Output Style** | Response verbosity | Step-by-step, Minimal code, Annotated |
| **Tone** | Communication voice | Analytical, Direct, Encouraging |
| **Interaction Mode** | AI proactivity level | Advisory, Pair-programming, Driver |

**Purpose:** Ensures AI behavior adapts appropriately as you move through different stages of work.

## Quick Start

### For First-Time Users

1. **Create Your Persona:**
   - **Manual:** Copy `templates/persona_template.instructions.md`, fill in your details, and save as `yourname_persona.instructions.md`
   - **AI-Assisted:** Use `prompts/create-persona-instructions.prompt.md` with your preferred AI assistant for guided creation

2. **Create Project Instructions:**
   - **Manual:** Copy `templates/project_template.instructions.md` and define your project
   - **AI-Assisted:** Use `prompts/create-project-instructions.prompt.md` for guided project setup
   - Save in `projects/` folder with descriptive names (e.g., `projectname_project.instructions.md`)

3. **Validate Your Instructions (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Use `prompts/validate-persona-instructions.prompt.md` to check your persona file
   - Use `prompts/validate-project-instructions.prompt.md` to check your project files
   - Validation creates a `.validation.md` report with scoring and recommendations

4. **Load Into Your AI Environment:**
   - See platform-specific instructions below

### For Returning Users

- Load your persona instructions as the base context
- Add the relevant project instructions on top
- The AI will maintain state across your work session

## Loading Context in Different AI Platforms

| Platform | Method |
|----------|---------|
| **Anthropic Claude Projects** | Paste persona + project instructions into the *Project Knowledge* or *Custom Instructions* field |
| **GitHub Copilot Edits** | Place `.instructions.md` files in workspace; Copilot automatically discovers and loads them |
| **MCP-Compatible Clients** | Use the included **MCP Server** (see [mcp-server/README.md](mcp-server/README.md)) to expose instructions via Model Context Protocol |
| **LM Studio / Ollama** | Save `.instructions.md` files as system prompts or instruction presets |
| **OpenAI ChatGPT** | Paste into *Custom Instructions* or upload as a file |
| **Gemini** | Paste into chat or use as system instruction |
| **Local scripts / APIs** | Concatenate persona + project instructions when initializing conversations |
| **IDE integrations** | Reference `.instructions.md` files in config or load via custom extensions |

### MCP Server Integration

This repository includes a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** implementation that exposes your persona and project instructions as MCP tools. This enables seamless integration with MCP-compatible AI clients like Claude Desktop and VS Code with GitHub Copilot.

**Key Features:**
- 14 MCP tools for managing persona and project instructions
- File-based content provider with intelligent caching
- Works with Claude Desktop, VS Code, and other MCP clients
- 101 comprehensive tests ensuring reliability

**Learn more:** See [mcp-server/README.md](mcp-server/README.md) for installation, configuration, and usage examples.

## How It Works

### Context Control

You can modify session state dynamically using:

- **Natural language:** "Switch to Developer Mode" or "Move to Implementation Phase"
- **Commands:** `/mode developer`, `/phase implementation`, `/context` (shows current state)
- **Project defaults:** Each project can define typical starting configurations

### Design Principles

- **Determinism:** Same context + same query = consistent responses
- **Explicitness:** AI confirms context changes rather than assuming
- **Continuity:** Session state persists across conversation turns
- **Reversibility:** All context changes can be undone
- **Transparency:** Current context is always visible on request

---

## Customization

### Creating Your Persona

The persona file includes both a **human-readable system prompt** and **machine-readable JSON metadata**, ensuring compatibility with various AI platforms.

Key sections to customize:
- About (role, location, ecosystem preferences)
- Projects (with platforms and status)
- Skills (categorized by domain)
- Goals and Constraints
- Preferred working style
- Current focus areas

### Creating Project Instructions

Each project instruction set should define:
- Project description and tech stack
- Supported AI roles for this project
- Default role and phase
- Phase-specific guidelines
- Output preferences
- Constraints and special considerations

---

## Prompt System

This repository includes a comprehensive **prompt system** for creating and validating instruction files:

### Creation Prompts

- **`prompts/create-persona-instructions.prompt.md`**
  - 6-phase guided workflow for creating personal persona files
  - Covers 15 required sections including professional background, technical skills, projects, and preferences
  - Supports complex scenarios: dual professional contexts, 10+ projects, certifications, open source goals
  - Generates both markdown and JSON metadata
  - Privacy-conscious with placeholder support

- **`prompts/create-project-instructions.prompt.md`**
  - 7-phase guided workflow for creating project instruction files
  - Covers 17 required sections per Context-Aware AI Session Flow Specification v1.2
  - Includes session state model (6 elements) and command reference (7 commands)
  - Defines AI roles, phases, and example task patterns
  - Ensures spec compliance from the start

### Validation Prompts

- **`prompts/validate-persona-instructions.prompt.md`**
  - 5-phase validation workflow with 100-point scoring system
  - Validates YAML frontmatter, all 15 required sections, content completeness, and spec v1.2 compliance
  - Generates `.validation.md` report with pass/fail status, issues, and recommendations
  - Perfect for self-validation, CI/CD integration, and quality assurance

- **`prompts/validate-project-instructions.prompt.md`**
  - 5-phase validation workflow with 100-point scoring system
  - Validates YAML frontmatter, all 17 required sections, session state model, and role definitions
  - Generates `.validation.md` report with detailed findings and example fixes
  - Includes common validation scenarios and troubleshooting

### How to Use Prompts

1. **Copy the prompt content** into your preferred AI assistant (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Mistral, etc.)
2. **Follow the guided workflow** - the AI will ask questions and gather information
3. **Review the generated output** - creation prompts produce complete instruction files
4. **Validate your work** - use validation prompts to check for completeness and compliance
5. **Iterate as needed** - validation reports provide specific recommendations

### Validation Reports

Validation prompts create persistent `.validation.md` files alongside your instruction files:

- **Location:** Same directory as the validated file
- **Naming:** `[filename].validation.md` (e.g., `marco_persona.validation.md`)
- **Overwrite:** Each validation replaces the previous report
- **Format:** Comprehensive markdown report with scoring, issues, and recommendations
- **Benefits:** Easy review for both humans and LLMs, enables chunk-based processing

---

## Conventions

- **File format:** UTF-8 Markdown
  - `.instructions.md` for both persona and project files (persistent context and guidelines)
  - Actual prompts/queries are what you ask the AI day-to-day within this instructed environment
- **Naming:** lowercase with underscores (e.g., `yourname_persona.instructions.md`, `projectname_project.instructions.md`)
- **Structure:** Consistent headings and sections across all files
- **Languages:** Technical content in English; adapt as needed
- **Versioning:** Update persona when skills/preferences evolve; update project instructions when phases change
- **Discoverability:** Semantic file extensions help AI tools identify and load the appropriate instructions automatically

---

## Getting Started with This Template

This is a **GitHub template repository**. Here's how to use it:

### Creating Your Own Instance

1. **Use the Template:**
   - Click the green **"Use this template"** button on GitHub
   - Choose **"Create a new repository"**
   - Give it a name (e.g., `my-ai-instructions` or `ai-workspace-config`)
   - **Make it Private** (recommended - contains personal information)
   - GitHub will create a fresh copy for you

2. **Customize Your Instance:**
   - Clone your new repository locally
   - Start with `templates/persona_template.instructions.md`
   - Fill in your professional details, skills, and preferences
   - Save as `yourname_persona.instructions.md` in the root
   - Create project instructions from `templates/project_template.instructions.md`
   - Save in `projects/` folder

3. **Keep It Updated:**
   - Update your persona as your skills evolve
   - Add new projects as you start them
   - Version control tracks your AI workspace evolution

### Why Use Template Instead of Fork?

- **Clean history:** Your repository starts fresh without this template's history
- **Private by default:** Easily make your instance private (recommended)
- **No upstream confusion:** It's your repository, not a fork
- **Your data, your control:** Personal instructions stay in your private repo

### Keeping Your Instance Up-to-Date

When the template repository gets improvements, here's how to pull them into your instance:

**Option 1: Manual Updates (Recommended)**
```bash
# Add the template as a remote (one-time setup)
git remote add template https://github.com/MSiccDev/persona-template.git

# Fetch template updates
git fetch template

# Review what changed in the template
git log template/main

# Cherry-pick specific improvements you want
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Or merge specific files manually
git checkout template/main -- README.md
git checkout template/main -- specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md
git checkout template/main -- templates/
```

**Option 2: Automated Merge (Use with Caution)**
```bash
# Merge all template changes
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve conflicts (protect your personal files!)
# Commit the merge
```

**Best Practice:**
- Watch/star the template repository to get notified of updates
- Review the CHANGELOG or commit history before updating
- Only pull updates that add value to your workflow
- **Always protect your personal instruction files** - never overwrite them

**What to Update:**
- ✅ Template files in `templates/`
- ✅ Specification documents in `specs/`
- ✅ README improvements
- ❌ Your personal `*_persona.instructions.md`
- ❌ Your project files in `projects/`

### Contributing Back

## Acknowledgments

This instruction-based system evolved from the challenge of maintaining consistent AI collaboration across multiple platforms and projects. 

**The Evolution:**
- **Phase 1:** Started as a way to extract and reuse prompts across AI providers
- **Phase 2:** Evolved into structured, persistent context management
- **Phase 3:** Matured into a complete instruction-based architecture for AI workspace configuration

What makes this approach powerful is the shift from treating every AI interaction as isolated to creating **persistent, layered instruction sets** that transform how AI assistants understand and support your work.

This represents lessons learned from extensive work with various LLM providers (Anthropic Claude, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Mistral, Gemini, and local models) and real-world development workflows across multiple projects and domains.

---

## Philosophy

**Traditional approach:**
- User sends isolated prompts
- AI has no continuity between sessions
- Constant re-explanation of context
- Inconsistent results across providers

**Instruction-based approach:**
- User loads instruction sets once
- AI maintains persistent understanding
- Context builds and evolves naturally
- Consistent collaboration regardless of provider

This isn't just about efficiency—it's about creating a fundamentally different relationship between developers and AI assistants, where the AI becomes a true collaborative partner rather than a stateless tool.
