# Validate Persona Instructions File

## Mission

Validate an existing persona instruction file (`.instructions.md`) to ensure it meets all requirements of the **Context-Aware AI Session Flow Specification v1.2**, is complete, properly formatted, and follows best practices.

## Scope & Preconditions

**Prerequisites:**
- User has an existing persona instruction file to validate
- File should be accessible for reading and analysis

**Target Output:**
- Comprehensive validation report with pass/fail status
- Specific issues identified with line numbers or section references
- Actionable recommendations for improvements
- Migration guidance if upgrading from older format

## Validation Workflow

Execute validation in five phases:

### Phase 1: YAML Frontmatter Validation

**Check:**
1. YAML frontmatter block exists and is properly formatted
2. Required attribute `applyTo` is present (must be `"**/*"`)
3. Required attribute `description` is present and descriptive
4. No unsupported attributes (e.g., `version`, `last_updated`, `persona_type`, `scope`, `name`)
5. Description format follows convention: `'Personal AI collaboration context for {Name/Role} - {Focus} ({Ecosystem})'`

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Valid YAML syntax
- ✅ Only supported attributes present
- ✅ `applyTo: "**/*"` specified
- ✅ Description is clear and contextual

**Common Issues:**
- Using `version` or `last_updated` as separate fields (should be in description)
- Missing `applyTo` attribute
- Using `name` attribute (not supported for persona files)

---

### Phase 2: Required Sections Validation

**Check all 15 required sections are present:**

1. **Personal Persona – {Name/Role}** (H1 heading)
2. **Professional Background** (H2) - Role, company, location, focus
3. **Technical Expertise** (H2) - Languages, frameworks, tools, architecture
4. **Current Projects** (H2) - Active projects with context
5. **Professional Goals** (H2) - Objectives and aspirations
6. **Working Style** (H2) - Workflow, process, problem-solving
7. **Format Preferences** (H2) - Documentation, code, diagrams
8. **Quality Standards** (H2) - Testing, code review, expectations
9. **Documentation Preferences** (H2) - Comments, README, API docs
10. **Communication Style** (H2) - Tone, explanation depth, terminology
11. **Context Handling** (H2) - Ambiguity resolution, prioritization
12. **Time & Schedule** (H2) - Working constraints, availability
13. **Resource Constraints** (H2) - Team, budget, technology limitations
14. **Technical Constraints** (H2) - Platform, performance, security requirements
15. **Exclusions & Prohibitions** (H2) - What to avoid

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ All 15 sections present with correct heading levels
- ✅ Sections appear in logical order
- ✅ Each section has substantive content (not just placeholders)

**Common Issues:**
- Missing newer sections (Context Handling, Exclusions & Prohibitions)
- Using wrong heading levels (H3 instead of H2)
- Empty placeholder sections like "[To be completed]"

**Completeness for Context-Aware Collaboration:**
- [ ] Enough detail for AI to understand user's expertise level
- [ ] Clear constraints to prevent unwanted suggestions
- [ ] Explicit communication preferences to avoid misalignment
- [ ] Project context to enable focused assistance

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Follows instruction-based paradigm (not just prompts/queries)
- ✅ Provider-agnostic and portable
- ✅ Comprehensive enough for effective AI collaboration

## Validation Report Format

### Step 1: Create/Overwrite Validation Summary File

Before generating the report:

1. **Determine file location**: Same directory as the validated persona file
2. **Generate filename**: `[original-filename-without-extension].validation.md`
   - Example: For `name_surname_persona.instructions.md`, create `name_surname_persona.validation.md`
3. **Overwrite rule**: If a `.validation.md` file for this persona already exists, delete it first
4. **Purpose**: Provides a persistent, chunk-friendly record that both humans and LLMs can easily reference

### Step 2: Generate Comprehensive Validation Report

Write the following structured validation report to the validation summary file:

```markdown
# Persona Instruction Validation Report

**File:** `{filename}`
**Validated:** {date}
**Spec Version:** v1.2

```markdown
## Context Handling

### Ambiguity Resolution
When requests are unclear, ask clarifying questions immediately rather than making assumptions.

### Context Prioritization
Always prioritize:
1. Current project focus
2. Quality standards (TDD, test coverage)
3. Learning goals (new frameworks or patterns)

### Session Continuity
Build on prior context without requiring re-explanation of background or preferences.

## Best Practices for Validation

1. **Read the entire file first** - Get full context before flagging issues
2. **Be specific** - Provide line numbers or section names for issues
3. **Prioritize issues** - Critical (blocking) vs. warnings (nice-to-have)
4. **Provide examples** - Show correct implementation for each issue
5. **Consider privacy** - Don't expose sensitive information in validation report
6. **Be constructive** - Frame feedback as improvements, not criticism
7. **Check for consistency** - Ensure placeholders, terminology, and style are uniform
8. **Validate JSON carefully** - One syntax error breaks the entire metadata block
9. **Respect user's choices** - Some optional fields are genuinely optional
10. **Suggest migration paths** - If upgrading from v1, provide clear steps
