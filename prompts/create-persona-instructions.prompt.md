# Generate Persona Instructions File

## Mission

Generate a complete personal persona instruction file (`.instructions.md`) that provides AI assistants with context about your professional background, working style, and preferences. This file works across all LLM providers and forms the foundation for personalized AI collaboration.

## Scope & Preconditions

**Prerequisites:**
- User wants to create a personal persona for AI collaboration
- Repository follows the persona template system structure
- User is willing to share professional information (privacy-conscious approach)

**Target Output:**
- Single `.instructions.md` file in workspace root or designated location
- Follows YAML frontmatter requirements (applyTo, description)
- Contains 15 required sections covering identity, skills, preferences, and constraints
- Privacy-conscious with support for placeholders and anonymization
- Portable across Claude, GPT, Gemini, Mistral, LM Studio, and Ollama

## Inputs

**Required Information:**
Gather personal and professional details through systematic discovery phases. Respect privacy boundaries and offer placeholder options for sensitive information.

**Context Variables:**
- Reference existing examples in workspace via codebase search
- Check templates in `templates/persona_template.instructions.md` for structure
- Respect user's privacy preferences throughout the interview

**Privacy Guidelines:**
- Offer `[Your Name]`, `[Your Company]`, etc. placeholders for sensitive data
- Never pressure the user to share personal information
- Clearly explain what information is optional vs. required
- Suggest anonymization strategies when appropriate

## Workflow

Execute discovery in six phases. Complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Personal Identity & Professional Background

**Questions:**
1. What name would you like the AI to use when addressing you? (Can be first name, nickname, or placeholder like "[Your Name]")
2. What is your current professional role or title? (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer", "Freelance Developer", "Technical Lead")
3. What company or organization do you work for? (Can use placeholder like "[Your Company]" if preferred)
4. **[Optional]** Do you have independent/side work, consulting, or a business label?
   - If yes, what is the name and when was it founded?
   - What is your role in this independent work? (e.g., "Independent developer", "Consultant", "Content creator")
5. **[Optional]** Are you involved in content creation, speaking, or community activities?
   - If yes, what type? (e.g., "Technical blogging", "Conference speaking", "Open source maintainer", "YouTube tutorials")

## Example Reference

If the user requests to see an example, reference these files in the repository:
- `templates/persona_template.instructions.md` - Complete template structure
- Look for other `*_persona.instructions.md` files in the workspace

---

## Best Practices

1. **Respect Privacy** - Never pressure users to share sensitive information; always offer placeholders
2. **Be Thorough** - Ask follow-up questions if responses are vague or incomplete
3. **Adapt to Context** - Adjust questions based on the user's role (e.g., freelancer vs. enterprise developer, solo developer vs. team lead)
4. **Capture Dual Contexts** - Many professionals have both employment and indie/side work; capture both when present
5. **Support Power Users** - Some users manage 6-10+ projects; the persona should scale to their complexity
6. **Track Certifications** - Include dates and scores for certifications to show progression and achievement
7. **Document Open Source Goals** - If the user contributes to or maintains open source, capture their community engagement goals
8. **Focus on Actionability** - Capture information that will make AI assistance more effective
9. **Encourage Updates** - Remind users that this file should evolve with their career and projects
10. **Cross-Reference Projects** - Link persona to project-specific instruction files for complete context
11. **Validate Portability** - Ensure the generated file works across all LLM providers
12. **Balance Detail and Brevity** - Provide enough context without overwhelming the file
13. **Highlight Constraints** - Make limitations and exclusions prominent to prevent unwanted suggestions
14. **Include Examples** - When capturing preferences, use concrete examples to clarify expectations
15. **Consider Family Context** - For projects with family use cases, document those considerations

---

## Privacy Notice Template

If the user opts for placeholders, include this notice in the generated file:

```markdown
---

## Privacy Notice

This persona file uses placeholders to protect sensitive information:
- `[Your Name]` - Replace with your actual name if desired
- `[Your Company]` - Replace with your employer or organization
- `[Your Location]` - Replace with your city, country, or timezone
- `[Project Name]` - Replace with actual project names when sharing is appropriate

You can customize the level of detail based on where and how you use this file. For public repositories, consider keeping placeholders. For private or local use, you may replace them with actual information.
