# Generate Project Instructions File

## Mission

Generate a complete, spec-compliant project instruction file (`.instructions.md`) that enables consistent, context-aware AI collaboration following the **Context-Aware AI Session Flow Specification v1.2**.

## Scope & Preconditions

**Prerequisites:**
- User has an active project requiring AI collaboration context
- Repository follows the persona template system structure
- Specification file exists at `specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md`

**Target Output:**
- Single `.instructions.md` file in `projects/` directory
- Follows YAML frontmatter requirements (name, description, applyTo)
- Contains all 17 required sections per specification v1.2
- Includes role definitions, session state model, and command reference

## Inputs

**Required Information:**
Gather project details through systematic discovery phases. Request clarification when responses are vague or incomplete.

**Context Variables:**
- Reference existing examples in `projects/` directory via codebase search
- Access specification at `specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md` for validation
- Check templates in `templates/project_template.instructions.md` for structure

## Workflow

## Generation Rules

After gathering all information, generate the complete project instruction file following these rules:

### YAML Frontmatter (Required)
```yaml
---
name: {project-name-slug}  # lowercase, hyphens only (e.g., "twist-reader", "persona-mcp-server")
description: Project-specific instructions for {Project Name} (v{version}, spec v1.2, updated {date})
applyTo: "**/*"
---
```

### Required Sections (in order)
1. **Project Context – {Project Name}** (H1 heading)
2. **Session Prerequisites** - Context hierarchy and spec reference
3. **Overview** - Project description and current status
4. **Default Session State** - Table with all session elements
5. **State Management & Control** - Context visibility, transitions, commands
6. **Role Definitions** - Table with roles, use cases, behaviors, outputs
7. **Tech Stack** - Languages, frameworks, architecture, repo structure
8. **Current Objectives** - Phase-aligned goals
9. **Development Principles** - Core practices and standards
10. **Repository Context** - Branch info, paths, configuration
11. **Working Together** - Task patterns for each role with examples
12. **Key Components** - Major modules/services with details
13. **Testing Strategy** - Approach, organization, coverage
14. **Documentation Standards** - Types and formats
15. **Testing Commands** - Practical command examples
16. **Related Files** - Cross-references
17. **Future Roadmap** - Planned features and maintenance

### Command Reference Template
Include this standard command table:
```markdown
| Command | Parameters | Description | Example |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `/context` | — | Display current session state | `/context` |
| `/mode [role]` | Role names (lowercase) | Switch assistant role | `/mode developer` |
| `/phase [name]` | Phase names (lowercase) | Update work phase | `/phase testing` |
| `/style [type]` | `structured` \| `minimal` \| `detailed` \| `annotated` | Change output verbosity | `/style minimal` |
| `/tone [style]` | `technical` \| `direct` \| `detailed` \| `concise` | Adjust communication tone | `/tone concise` |
| `/interact [mode]` | `advisory` \| `pair` \| `driver` | Set collaboration style | `/interact pair` |
| `/reset` | — | Clear session state (keeps persona & project) | `/reset` |
```

### Role Definition Table Template
For each role, provide:
```markdown
| Role | When to Use | Assistant Behavior | Typical Outputs |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **{Role Name}** | {Scenarios for using this role} | {How assistant behaves in this role} | {Types of outputs produced} |
```

### Example Task Patterns Template
For each role, provide 3-5 example requests:
```markdown
**{Role Name} ({Role Mode}):**
- *"Example request 1"*
- *"Example request 2"*
- *"Example request 3"*
```

### Formatting Standards
- Use H2 (`##`) for major sections
- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Use tables for structured data (Session State, Roles, Commands)
- Use code blocks with language tags for commands and examples
- Use bold for emphasis on key terms
- Use italics for example natural language commands
- Include horizontal rules (`---`) between major sections

### Validation Checklist

## Example Reference

If the user requests to see an example, reference these files in the repository:
- `projects/persona_template_project.instructions.md` - .NET/C# MCP server project
- Look for other `*_project.instructions.md` files in the `projects/` directory

---

## Best Practices

1. **Be thorough in discovery** - Ask clarifying questions if responses are vague
2. **Adapt role suggestions** - Recommend roles that make sense for the specific tech stack
3. **Provide realistic defaults** - Default session state should match the current project phase
4. **Include actionable examples** - Example task patterns should be specific to the project
5. **Cross-reference documentation** - Link to existing specs, READMEs, and architecture docs
6. **Future-proof the structure** - Include Future Roadmap even if it's minimal
7. **Follow spec v1.2** - Ensure all session state elements and transition rules are included
