# Validate Project Instructions File

## Mission

Validate an existing project instruction file (`.instructions.md`) to ensure it meets all requirements of the **Context-Aware AI Session Flow Specification v1.2**, is complete, properly formatted, and follows best practices.

## Scope & Preconditions

**Prerequisites:**
- User has an existing project instruction file to validate
- File should be accessible for reading and analysis

**Target Output:**
- Comprehensive validation report with pass/fail status
- Specific issues identified with line numbers or section references
- Actionable recommendations for improvements
- Migration guidance if upgrading from older format

## Validation Workflow

Execute validation in five phases:

### Phase 1: YAML Frontmatter Validation

**Check:**
1. YAML frontmatter block exists and is properly formatted
2. Required attribute `name` is present (lowercase, hyphens/underscores/periods only)
3. Required attribute `description` is present and descriptive
4. Required attribute `applyTo` is present (must be `"**/*"`)
5. No unsupported attributes
6. Description format follows convention: `'Project-specific instructions for {Project Name} (v{version}, spec v1.2, updated {date})'`

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Valid YAML syntax
- ✅ All required attributes present
- ✅ `name` uses valid characters only
- ✅ `applyTo: "**/*"` specified
- ✅ Description is clear and includes version/date

**Common Issues:**
- `name` using uppercase letters or spaces
- Missing `applyTo` attribute
- Using unsupported attributes from older specs

---

### Phase 2: Required Sections Validation

**Check all 17 required sections are present:**

1. **Project Context – {Project Name}** (H1 heading)
2. **Session Prerequisites** (H2) - Context hierarchy and spec reference
3. **Overview** (H2) - Project description and current status
4. **Default Session State** (H2) - Table with all session elements
5. **State Management & Control** (H2) - Context visibility, transitions, commands
6. **Role Definitions** (H2) - Table with roles, use cases, behaviors, outputs
7. **Tech Stack** (H2) - Languages, frameworks, architecture, repo structure
8. **Current Objectives** (H2) - Phase-aligned goals
9. **Development Principles** (H2) - Core practices and standards
10. **Repository Context** (H2) - Branch info, paths, configuration
11. **Working Together** (H2) - Task patterns for each role with examples
12. **Key Components** (H2) - Major modules/services with details
13. **Testing Strategy** (H2) - Approach, organization, coverage
14. **Documentation Standards** (H2) - Types and formats
15. **Testing Commands** (H2) - Practical command examples
16. **Related Files** (H2) - Cross-references
17. **Future Roadmap** (H2) - Planned features and maintenance

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ All 17 sections present with correct heading levels
- ✅ Sections appear in correct order
- ✅ Each section has substantive content (not just placeholders)

**Common Issues:**
- Missing newer sections (State Management & Control, Future Roadmap)
- Wrong heading levels (H3 instead of H2)
- Sections out of order
- Empty placeholder sections

---

### Phase 3: Session State Model Validation

**Default Session State Table:**
Must include all 6 elements:
1. **Project** - Project name or identifier
2. **Role** - Default role when starting work
3. **Phase** - Current work phase (Planning, Active Development, Maintenance, etc.)
4. **Output Style** - Default formatting preference (Structured, Minimal, Detailed, Annotated)
5. **Tone** - Communication style (Professional & Technical, Direct, Detailed, Friendly)
6. **Interaction Mode** - Collaboration approach (Advisory, Pair Programming, Driver)

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Table format with all 6 elements
- ✅ Each element has a defined default value
- ✅ Values are appropriate for the project

**Command Reference Table:**
Must include standard commands:
- `/context` - Display current session state
- `/mode [role]` - Switch assistant role
- `/phase [name]` - Update work phase
- `/style [type]` - Change output verbosity
- `/tone [style]` - Adjust communication tone
- `/interact [mode]` - Set collaboration style
- `/reset` - Clear session state

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ All 7 standard commands present
- ✅ Table format with columns: Command, Parameters, Description, Example
- ✅ Examples provided for each command

**Common Issues:**
- Missing session elements (often Interaction Mode)
- Command table incomplete or missing
- Default values too generic ("TBD", "None")

---

### Phase 4: Role Definitions Validation

**Role Definitions Table:**
Must include:
- At least 3 roles defined
- Each role has: Role Name, When to Use, Assistant Behavior, Typical Outputs
- Roles appropriate for the project's tech stack and objectives

**Example Task Patterns:**
For each defined role:
- 3-5 example natural language requests
- Examples specific to the project (not generic)
- Use italics for example requests

**Role Transition Examples:**
- Shows both natural language ("Switch to Developer Mode") and command (`/mode developer`)
- Explains when/why to switch roles

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ At least 3 roles defined with complete details
- ✅ Role definitions table properly formatted
- ✅ Example task patterns provided for each role
- ✅ Role transitions explained

**Common Issues:**
- Generic roles without project-specific context
- Missing example task patterns
- No explanation of when to use each role
- Roles don't match project tech stack

## Validation Report Format

### Step 1: Create/Overwrite Validation Summary File

Before generating the report:

1. **Determine file location**: Same directory as the validated project file
2. **Generate filename**: `[original-filename-without-extension].validation.md`
   - Example: For `nextjs_app_project.instructions.md`, create `nextjs_app_project.validation.md`
3. **Overwrite rule**: If a `.validation.md` file for this project already exists, delete it first
4. **Purpose**: Provides a persistent, chunk-friendly record that both humans and LLMs can easily reference

### Step 2: Generate Comprehensive Validation Report

Write the following structured validation report to the validation summary file:

```markdown
# Project Instruction Validation Report

**File:** `{filename}`
**Project:** {project-name}
**Validated:** {date}
**Spec Version:** v1.2

## Best Practices for Validation

1. **Read the entire file first** - Get full context before flagging issues
2. **Be specific** - Provide line numbers or section names for issues
3. **Prioritize issues** - Critical (blocking) vs. warnings (nice-to-have)
4. **Provide examples** - Show correct implementation for each issue
5. **Check role alignment** - Roles should match project tech stack and objectives
6. **Validate commands** - Ensure testing commands are executable, not placeholders
7. **Check consistency** - Session state elements should align with project reality
8. **Be constructive** - Frame feedback as improvements, not criticism
9. **Consider context** - Some projects may have valid reasons for variations
10. **Suggest migration paths** - If upgrading from older spec, provide clear steps

## Common Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Missing Session State Element
**Issue:** Default Session State table missing "Interaction Mode"
**Impact:** AI won't know default collaboration style (Advisory, Pair, Driver)
**Fix:** Add row to table with appropriate default for the project

### Scenario 2: Generic Role Definitions
**Issue:** Roles are too generic ("Developer", "Tester") without project context
**Impact:** AI can't provide project-specific assistance
**Fix:** Make roles specific to tech stack ("Swift Developer", "React Developer")

### Scenario 3: Placeholder Commands
**Issue:** Testing commands contain placeholders like `[run your tests here]`
**Impact:** AI can't provide actual executable commands
**Fix:** Replace with real commands: `dotnet test`, `swift test`, `npm test`

### Scenario 4: Missing Command Reference
**Issue:** No command table for session state control
**Impact:** Users don't know how to switch roles or phases
**Fix:** Add complete command table with all 7 standard commands

### Scenario 5: Incomplete Tech Stack
**Issue:** Tech stack section lists languages but no frameworks or architecture
**Impact:** AI lacks context for technical decisions
**Fix:** Add frameworks, architecture pattern, testing approach, repo structure
